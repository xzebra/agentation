          <h1>Introducing Agentation 2.0</h1>
          <p className="tagline">A new way for humans and AI to collaborate on UI</p>
        </header>

        <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: "0.5rem", marginBottom: "0.75rem" }}>
          <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            Since launch, Agentation has already become part of how a lot of developers work with AI on UI. <a href="https://github.com/benjitaylor/agentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,500+ GitHub stars</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/agentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tens of thousands of installs</a>.
          </p>

          <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            Version 1 was <em>annotate, copy, paste</em>. You&rsquo;d annotate something, copy the structured output, hand it to your agent. Good context, but requires a manual handoff.
          </p>

          <p style={{ margin: 0 }}>
            Version 2 is <em>annotate and collaborate</em>. Your agent sees your annotations directly. It has the full picture: what you&rsquo;re pointing at, what you said, what&rsquo;s pending across your whole site. You work together until it&rsquo;s fixed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <section>
          <h2 id="mcp">MCP Integration</h2>
          <p>
            The <Link href="/mcp">Model Context Protocol server</Link> is the biggest addition in 2.0. It&rsquo;s what makes the direct connection possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            With MCP, agents can fetch your current annotations, acknowledge them, ask follow-up questions, resolve issues with summaries, or dismiss feedback with reasons. Your annotations flow directly into the agent&rsquo;s context.
          </p>
          <p>
            The server runs locally and supports multiple interfaces: MCP tools for direct agent integration, an HTTP API for custom workflows, and Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. It&rsquo;s designed to work with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here&rsquo;s what the workflow looks like:
          </p>
          <div style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem", fontSize: "0.8125rem", lineHeight: 1.7, background: "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02)", padding: "1rem 1.25rem", borderRadius: "0.5rem" }}>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "rgba(0,0,0,0.4)" }}>You:</span> &ldquo;What annotations do I have?&rdquo;</p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "#4a9eff" }}>Agent:</span> &ldquo;3 annotations: button on /checkout, contrast on /settings, typo on /about.&rdquo;</p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "rgba(0,0,0,0.4)" }}>You:</span> &ldquo;Fix the button&rdquo;</p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "#4a9eff" }}>Agent:</span> &ldquo;Left-align or center with the form?&rdquo;</p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "rgba(0,0,0,0.4)" }}>You:</span> &ldquo;Center&rdquo;</p>
            <p style={{ margin: "0.375rem 0" }}><span style={{ color: "#4a9eff" }}>Agent:</span> &ldquo;Done. Marked as resolved.&rdquo;</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="sessions">Sessions &amp; Smart Filtering</h2>
          <p>
            Every browser tab now gets its own <Link href="/mcp#sessions">session</Link>, and every annotation carries rich metadata: when it was created, when it was last updated, its current status, and who resolved it. This unlocks entirely new ways to work with feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ask your agent things like:
          </p>
          <ul style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", lineHeight: 1.7, marginTop: "0.5rem", paddingLeft: "1.25rem" }}>
            <li>&ldquo;What feedback has been waiting the longest?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Show me just the blocking issues&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Which pages have unresolved annotations?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>&ldquo;What did I mark as a question vs a fix request?&rdquo;</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            Status transitions are first-class too. When an agent starts working on your feedback, it can mark it as <em>acknowledged</em> so you know it&rsquo;s in progress. When it&rsquo;s done, it resolves with a summary. If it decides not to act, it dismisses with a reason. Every state change is timestamped, so you always know the full history.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="schema">Standardized Schema</h2>
          <p>
            We&rsquo;ve published a formal <Link href="/schema">Annotation Format Schema</Link> that defines exactly how annotations are structured. The schema makes annotations portable across tools and predictable for anything that consumes them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The schema includes <Link href="/schema#annotation-object">intent and severity fields</Link>, so you can flag something as a blocking bug vs a minor suggestion, or distinguish between &ldquo;fix this&rdquo; and &ldquo;I have a question about this.&rdquo; Agents can use these signals to prioritize work automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSON Schema and TypeScript definitions are both available. If you&rsquo;re building tools that consume annotations, the schema is your starting point.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="webhooks">Webhooks</h2>
          <p>
            <Link href="/webhooks">Webhooks</Link> let you subscribe to annotation events and push them anywhere. Configure a URL, and every annotation gets delivered as a structured JSON payload.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some workflows you could build:
          </p>
          <ul style={{ fontSize: "0.875rem", lineHeight: 1.7, marginTop: "0.5rem", paddingLeft: "1.25rem" }}>
            <li><strong>GitHub Issues:</strong> Automatically create issues from annotations, labeled by severity. Pair with a GitHub Action that triggers Claude Code to fix them.</li>
            <li><strong>Slack alerts:</strong> Post blocking issues to a channel with a &ldquo;Fix it&rdquo; button that invokes your agent.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear sync:</strong> Turn annotations into tickets, with component paths pre-filled so engineers know exactly where to look.</li>
            <li><strong>Review dashboard:</strong> Aggregate feedback across your team into a single view, sorted by age and severity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={{ marginTop: "0.75rem" }}>
            The schema is stable enough to build on. If you can receive a POST request, you can integrate Agentation into your workflow.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="react-detection">React Component Detection</h2>
          <p>
            When you hover over an element in a React app, Agentation now shows the full <Link href="/features#react-detection">component hierarchy</Link>. Not just the DOM element, but the actual components from your codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes it dramatically easier for AI agents to find the right file. Instead of searching for a class name that might be generated, they can search for <code>ProductCard</code> or <code>CheckoutButton</code>, the names you actually use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The detection adapts to your output format: minimal in Compact mode, framework-filtered in Standard, CSS-correlated in Detailed, and everything (including internals) in Forensic.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next</h2>
          <p>
            Agentation is still new. The vision is a world where UI feedback loops shrink from hours to seconds. Point at something, say what&rsquo;s wrong, and watch it get fixed in real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you haven&rsquo;t tried Agentation yet, <Link href="/install">install it</Link> and see how it changes the way you work with AI agents. If you&rsquo;re already using it, update to 2.0 and let us know what you think.
