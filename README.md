**[Agentation](https://agentation.dev)** is an agent-agnostic visual feedback tool. Click elements on your page, add notes, and copy structured output that helps AI coding agents find the exact code you're referring to.

## Install

```bash
npm install agentation -D
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { Agentation } from 'agentation';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <YourApp />
      <Agentation />
    </>
  );
}
```

The toolbar appears in the bottom-right corner. Click to activate, then click any element to annotate it.

## Features

- **Click to annotate** – Click any element with automatic selector identification
- **Text selection** – Select text to annotate specific content
- **Multi-select** – Drag to select multiple elements at once
- **Area selection** – Drag to annotate any region, even empty space
- **Animation pause** – Freeze CSS animations to capture specific states
- **Structured output** – Copy markdown with selectors, positions, and context
- **Dark/light mode** – Matches your preference or set manually
- **Zero dependencies** – Pure CSS animations, no runtime libraries

## How it works

Agentation captures class names, selectors, and element positions so AI agents can `grep` for the exact code you're referring to. Instead of describing "the blue button in the sidebar," you give the agent `.sidebar > button.primary` and your feedback.

## Requirements

- React 18+
- Desktop browser (mobile not supported)
